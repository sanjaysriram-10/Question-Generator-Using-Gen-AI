            "> Node.js operates on a single thread, using non-blocking I/O calls, allowing it to support tens of thousands of concurrent connections without incurring the cost of thread context switching. It uses asynchronous programming. A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client but servers should not be used for simple tasks when you can get them done without the help of servers. \n",
